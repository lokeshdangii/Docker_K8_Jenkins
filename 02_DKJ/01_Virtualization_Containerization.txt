Virtualization
==============


-> Installing Multiple Gues Operating System in one Host Operating System.

-> Hypervisor s/w will be used to achieve this.

-> We need to install all the required s/w in Host OS to run our application.

-> It is old technique to run the application.

-> System performance will become slow in this processs.

-> To overcome the problems of Virtualization we are going for containerizationconcept.



Containerization
==================

-> It is used to package all the s/w and application code in one container for execution.

-> container will take care of everything which is required to run our application.

-> we can run the containers in multiple machines easily.

-> Docker is a containerization software.

-> Using Docker we will create container for our application.

-> Using Docker we will create image for our application.

-> Docker images we can share easily to multiple machines.

-> Using Docker image we can create container and we can execute it.
