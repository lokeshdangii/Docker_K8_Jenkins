Application
++++++++++++

=> Application is nothing but collection of programs

=> Every application contains 3 layers

        1) Presentation layers (Frontedn (UI))
        2) Backend (Business logic)
        3) Database


=========================
Application Environment
=========================

=> In Realtime, our application will be deployed into multiple environments for testing purpose

    1) DEV Env [Developers Testing]
    2) SIT Env [Testing Team (QA)]
    3) UAT Env [Client Side Testing]
    4) PILOT Env (Pre-Prodcution)  [Testing with live data]

=> Once testing completed in all above envs that it will be deployed into production Env.

=> Prodcution env means live environment.

=> End users will access application from production env.


=====================
Life without Docker
=====================

=> We need to install required s/w in all environments to run our application.

=> We need to make sure we are using same versions of s/w in all machines.

=> If any s/w version is not matched then application execution may fail.

    Ex : Rancho installed Java 11v in Dev Env
         Raju installed Java 8v in SIT Env

=> If we want to run our application in multiple machines then we have to install required softwares in all those machines which is hectic task.


===================
Life with Docker
=================== 

=> Docker is a containerization platform

=> Docker is used to build and deploy our application into any machine without bothering about dependencies.

=> Dependencies means the s/w which are required to run our application.

        Dependencies = OS/ Angula/ React/ Java/ DB/ Tomcat etc...


=> Docker will reduce the gap between development and deployment.



Docker Architecture
=====================


1) Dockerfile : It contains instructions to build docker image

2) Docker Image : It is a package which contains code + dependencies

3) Docker Registry : It is a repository to store docker images

4) Docker Container : It is a runtime process which runs our application.


Note : Once Docker image is created then we can pull that image and we can run that image in any machine.


Virtualization
==============


-> Installing Multiple Gues Operating System in one Host Operating System.

-> Hypervisor s/w will be used to achieve this.

-> We need to install all the required s/w in Host OS to run our application.

-> It is old technique to run the application.

-> System performance will become slow in this processs.

-> To overcome the problems of Virtualization we are going for containerizationconcept.



Containerization
==================

-> It is used to package all the s/w and application code in one container for execution.

-> container will take care of everything which is required to run our application.

-> we can run the containers in multiple machines easily.

-> Docker is a containerization software.

-> Using Docker we will create container for our application.

-> Using Docker we will create image for our application.

-> Docker images we can share easily to multiple machines.

-> Using Docker image we can create container and we can execute it.



Docker Installation
===================

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl status docker

#add user to docker group 
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

#Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

#Restart the session
exit 

docker info 
docker -v



=> If the below error comes in ubuntu then follow the below steps

error => exec: "docker-credential-desktop.exe": executable file not found in $PATH

=========
Solution
=========

For Arch Linux edit the ~/.docker/config.json file and paste this code

{
    "auths": {},
    "credStore": "desktop",
    "currentContext": "default"
}
basically change credsStore to credStore
